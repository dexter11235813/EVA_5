<h2 align = 'center'> Assignment </h2>

This week's assignment is to take the best assignment from last week, and experiment and observe the effect of different regularizers on the validation accuracy and loss. The following combination of regularizers were studied for this assignment :- 
* `l1` regularizer with BatchNorm layers.
* `l2` regularizer with BatchNorm layers. 
* `l1` + `l2` regularizer along with the BatchNorm layers. 
* [Ghost Batch Normalization.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08741.pdf)
* `l1` + `l2` regularizer along with Ghost Batch Normalization.
